I have used 9 different regression algorithms. Finalized the tuned XGBoost model with 99.5% test R-squared.
ECL method is used for provisioning the capital buffer to protect banks against possible default of the customers. The ECL provisioning is a mandatory accounting principle set by the Basel III norms.

The Basel norms, also known as the Basel Accords or Basel Regulations, are a set of international regulatory standards for the banking industry. These norms were developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which is an international committee of banking supervisors from around the world. The committee was formed in 1974 by the central bank governors of the Group of Ten (G-10) countries. The history of the Basel norms can be traced back to the late 1970s and early 1980s when the banking industry was facing a series of crises and failures. These crises were caused by a combination of factors, including insufficient capital and liquidity, inadequate risk management and weak supervisory oversight. In response to these crises, the Basel Committee began to develop a set of international standards for bank capital and risk management to strengthen the resilience of the global banking system and reduce the risk of bank failures.

The first Basel Accord, known as Basel I, was issued in 1988, which introduced the first set of minimum capital requirements for banks. Basel I was revised in 2004 with the introduction of Basel II, which aimed to improve the risk sensitivity of the capital requirements and provide a more sophisticated approach to calculating capital ratios. Subsequently, Basel III was introduced in 2009, with stricter rules and regulations, largely in response to the financial crisis of 2007â€“2008 and the ensuing economic recession. It aimed to strengthen the resilience of the banking system against financial stress and improve the ability of banks to absorb losses.

The Basel norms are used to ensure that banks maintain sufficient levels of capital and liquidity to withstand financial shocks and reduce the risk of bank failures. The norms cover a range of areas, including minimum capital requirements, risk-weighted assets and the calculation of capital ratios. Banks are required to comply with the Basel norms to ensure the stability and resilience of the global financial system. Non-compliance with these norms can result in regulatory penalties and other consequences for banks.

To comply with the regulatory norms, a bank needs to provision funds. Provisioning refers to the process of setting aside funds to cover potential losses from defaulted loans. Therefore, provisioning is an important part of a bank's risk management strategy. The provisioning by banks is also an important macroeconomic metric to gauge the economic conditions of a country. Banks may use several methods to calculate the amount of provisioning required, such as lifetime expected loss (LEL), stressed loss analysis (SLA), current expected credit loss (CECL) and through-the-cycle (TTC) and expected credit loss (ECL).

For this assignment, we will focus on the expected credit loss (ECL) calculation method.

Expected credit loss (ECL) computation is a method used in credit risk management to determine the amount of loss a bank is expected to incur in the event a borrower defaults on their loan. Different banks may use different methodologies for calculating the expected credit loss (ECL) and provisioning. rk of a bank. Banks are allowed to use their own methodologies and incorporate factors relevant to their specific business operations. Some banks may choose to use historical data and statistical models to estimate the components of ECL calculation, while others may rely on expert judgement. The choice of the method can vary depending on factors such as the bank's risk appetite, the nature of the loans and the available data. Additionally, some banks may include certain external factors, such as macroeconomic conditions, in their calculations, while others may not.

The formula for ECL typically used in practice is as follows:

ECL = EAD x PD x LGD

Expected credit loss = Exposure at default x Probability of Default x Loss given default]

ECLs are calculated based on the exposure at default (EAD), probability of default (PD) and the loss given default (LGD) for each borrower. Banks can calculate the ECL for different points in time based on their risk management strategy and regulatory requirements.

For this assignment, we will consider the latest date from which the data is available as the point in time. This means we will estimate the expected credit loss (ECL) for the borrower assuming that the borrower has defaulted at the present point in time.
